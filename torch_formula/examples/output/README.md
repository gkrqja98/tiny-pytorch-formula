# Example Outputs

This directory contains output files generated by the example scripts. When you run the examples, visualizations, analysis reports, and other output files will be saved here.

The directory structure is as follows:

```
output/
├── value_computation/      # Output from detailed_value_computation.py
├── backward_computation/   # Output from detailed_backward_computation.py
├── backpropagation/        # Output from backpropagation_analysis.py
└── ...                     # Other outputs
```

Note: Most of these output files are not tracked in Git (they're in .gitignore) since they can be regenerated by running the examples.
